# Branch Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made in the `copilot/summarize-changes-and-create-tasks` branch compared to the `master` branch.

## Overview

This branch contains two main commits that implement significant infrastructure upgrades:

1. **Allow sqlite3 deployments from scratch** (commit dc21b163)
2. **Upgrade to Ruby 3.4.1 and Rails 7.2** (commit 75e18b9c)

## Detailed Changes

### 1. SQLite3 Deployment Support (dc21b163)

**Purpose**: Enable RMT to be deployed with SQLite3 as a database adapter from scratch.

**Key Changes**:

#### Configuration Updates
- **config/rmt.yml**: Made database adapter configurable via `RMT_DB_ADAPTER` environment variable
  - Old: Hard-coded `adapter: mysql2`
  - New: `adapter: <%= ENV.fetch('RMT_DB_ADAPTER') { 'mysql2' } %>`
  - Default remains mysql2 for backward compatibility

#### Documentation
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Updated documentation to reflect SQLite3 support

#### Database Migrations
Modified migrations to be SQLite3-compatible by adding conditional logic:

- **db/migrate/20180420145408_init_schema.rb**
  - Added `sqlite?` helper method
  - Wrapped MySQL-specific syntax in conditional blocks
  
- **db/migrate/20200723124836_add_uniqueness_to_downloaded_files_local_path.rb**
  - Added `sqlite?` helper method
  - Skipped MySQL-specific DELETE JOIN query for SQLite3 (not needed for new deployments)
  
- **db/migrate/20200916104804_make_scc_id_unique.rb**
  - Added `sqlite?` helper method
  - Skipped MySQL-specific data migration for SQLite3 deployments
  
- **db/migrate/20211017185107_add_proxy_byos_to_systems.rb**
  - Added reversibility support
  
- **db/migrate/20230814105634_move_hw_info_to_systems_table.rb**
  - Added `sqlite?` helper method
  - Made hardware info migration conditional for SQLite3
  
- **db/migrate/20240111200053_create_system_uptimes.rb**
  - Improved migration structure
  
- **db/migrate/20240729103525_update_proxy_byos_column_type.rb**
  - Added `sqlite?` helper method
  - Made column type update conditional for SQLite3

#### Database Schema
- **db/schema.rb**: Regenerated to reflect migration changes

**Rationale**: 
- SQLite3 deployments are new, so data migration paths designed for MySQL databases are not relevant
- MySQL-specific SQL syntax (like DELETE with JOIN) is not compatible with SQLite3
- Environment variable configuration provides flexibility without requiring manual config file edits

### 2. Ruby 3.4.1 and Rails 7.2 Upgrade (75e18b9c)

**Purpose**: Upgrade from Ruby 2.5.9 to Ruby 3.4.1 and from Rails 6.1.7 to Rails 7.2.

**Key Changes**:

#### Ruby Version
- **.ruby-version**: Changed from `2.5.9` to `3.4.1`

#### Dependency Management Strategy
Created separate Gemfiles for different Ruby versions:

- **Gemfile**: Now a symlink to `Gemfile-3.4`
- **Gemfile-2.5**: Preserved old dependencies for Ruby 2.5 (frozen)
- **Gemfile-2.5.lock**: Lock file for Ruby 2.5 dependencies
- **Gemfile-3.4**: New dependencies for Ruby 3.4
- **Gemfile-3.4.lock**: Lock file for Ruby 3.4 dependencies
- **Gemfile.lock**: Symlink to `Gemfile-3.4.lock`

#### Major Dependency Updates

**Rails Components** (6.1.7 → 7.2.x):
- activesupport: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`
- actionpack: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`
- actionview: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`
- activemodel: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`
- activerecord: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`
- railties: `~> 6.1.7` → `~> 7`

**Other Dependencies**:
- puma: `~> 5.6.2` → (unlocked, allows newer versions)
- mysql2: `~> 0.5.3` → (unlocked)
- nokogiri: `< 1.13` → (unlocked, was locked for Ruby >= 2.6 compatibility)
- thor: `<= 1.2.2` → (unlocked, was locked for Ruby >= 2.6 compatibility)
- Added `csv` gem (required separately in Ruby 3.4)

**Development Dependencies**:
- scc-codestyle: `<= 0.5.0` → (removed version lock)
- rubocop: `<= 1.25` → (removed version lock)
- rubocop-ast: `<= 1.17.0` → (removed version lock)
- ruby_parser: `< 3.20` → (removed version lock)
- listen: `>= 3.0.5, <= 3.6.0` → (removed upper bound)
- memory_profiler: `~> 1.0.2` → (removed, was locked for Ruby >= 3.1.0)

**Test Dependencies**:
- ffaker: `<= 2.21.0` → (removed version lock)
- shoulda-matchers: `~> 4.5.1` → (removed version lock)

#### Spring Removal
- **bin/spring**: Deleted (Spring development tool removed)
- **config/spring.rb**: Deleted
- Spring-related gems removed from Gemfile

**Rationale**: Spring is less commonly used in modern Rails development and can be removed to simplify the setup.

#### Code Updates

**app/models/system.rb**:
- Added explicit attribute definition: `attribute :proxy_byos_mode, :integer`
- Required for Rails 7.2 enum compatibility

**config/application.rb**:
- Updated Rails load paths configuration for Rails 7.2

**lib/rmt/logger.rb**:
- Updated logger initialization for compatibility with Rails 7.2

#### Test Updates

**spec/lib/rmt/http_request_spec.rb**:
- Updated test expectations for new HTTP library behavior

**spec/lib/suse/connect/api_spec.rb**:
- Updated VCR cassette matching strategy
- Changed from `:uri` to `:method` and `:uri` matching
- Updated test expectations for new behavior

**spec/models/downloaded_file_spec.rb**:
- Updated factory usage for Rails 7.2 compatibility

**spec/models/repository_spec.rb**:
- Updated factory usage for Rails 7.2 compatibility

#### CI/CD Updates

**.github/workflows/lint-unit.yml**:
- Updated Ruby version in CI workflow
- Added support for Ruby 3.4.1 testing

## Impact Summary

### Files Changed
- **27 files** modified
- **1,277 insertions**
- **653 deletions**

### Categories of Changes

1. **Infrastructure** (14 files)
   - Ruby version, Gemfiles, lock files, CI configuration

2. **Database** (10 files)
   - Migrations, schema, configuration

3. **Application Code** (1 file)
   - Model updates for Rails 7.2 compatibility

4. **Tests** (4 files)
   - Updated for new dependency behaviors

### Breaking Changes

**Potential Issues**:
- Applications relying on Spring will need to adapt
- Older gems locked to Ruby 2.5/2.6 compatibility are now unlocked
- Database migrations behave differently for SQLite3 vs MySQL

### Backward Compatibility

**Maintained**:
- MySQL remains the default database adapter
- Ruby 2.5 dependencies preserved in Gemfile-2.5 for reference
- Migration behavior unchanged for existing MySQL deployments

**Not Maintained**:
- Ruby 2.5.9 is no longer supported
- Rails 6.1.7 is no longer supported
- Spring development tool removed

## Technical Debt Addressed

1. **Dependency Locks**: Removed numerous version locks that were in place only for Ruby 2.5/2.6 compatibility
2. **Database Flexibility**: Made database adapter configurable via environment variable
3. **Migration Safety**: Added SQLite3 awareness to migrations to prevent issues with unsupported SQL syntax
4. **Test Suite**: Updated tests to work with newer dependency versions

---

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Large Version Jump**: Ruby 2.5.9 → 3.4.1 is a major jump (spanning multiple major versions)
2. **Rails Upgrade**: Rails 6.1 → 7.2 includes significant framework changes
3. **Gem Ecosystem**: Many gems needed updates to support Ruby 3.4 and Rails 7.2
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing required to ensure all functionality works with new versions
5. **SQLite3 Limitations**: SQLite3 deployments skip certain data migrations, which is acceptable for new deployments but should be documented

---

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Run full test suite and manual testing before deploying
2. **Staging Environment**: Test in staging with production-like data
3. **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback strategy ready if issues arise
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation to reflect Ruby 3.4.1 requirement
5. **Dependencies**: Ensure production environment can support Ruby 3.4.1
6. **Database Choice**: Document when SQLite3 vs MySQL should be used
