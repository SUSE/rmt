## Methodology

These documents were created by:

1. **Analyzing commit history** between `master` and current branch
2. **Examining file diffs** to understand each change
3. **Identifying patterns** across related changes
4. **Working backwards** from the final state to derive tasks
5. **Documenting context** from commit messages and code comments

## Contributing
