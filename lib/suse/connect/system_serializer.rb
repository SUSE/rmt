  # RMT has two modes of sending system information to SCC
  # 1) Full update mode
  #    When a system is changed or new RMT will send the full system
  #    information available to SCC.
  # 2) Keepalive mode (:needs_full_update?)
  #    Since the keepalive mechanism has been released in SUSEConnect
  #    RMT also sends system information to SCC (e.g. last_seen_at).
  #    This saves resouces since not the full system information needs
  #    to be processed.
