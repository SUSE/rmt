# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the latest version of RMT is supported. Whenever we release a new version of RMT, we submit it to all supported versions of SLE and openSUSE which support RMT.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please contact the [SUSE Security Team](https://www.suse.com/support/security/contact/) instead.
