# Executive Summary: Branch Changes

## What This Branch Does

This branch implements two major upgrades to the RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) project:

1. **Ruby 3.4.1 & Rails 7.2 Upgrade** - Modernizes the technology stack
2. **SQLite3 Support** - Enables lightweight deployments for development and testing

## The Big Picture

### Before
- Ruby 2.5.9 (released 2019, end of life)
- Rails 6.1.7
- MySQL-only deployment
- Many dependency version locks for old Ruby compatibility

### After
- Ruby 3.4.1 (latest, modern performance & features)
- Rails 7.2 (latest stable)
- MySQL OR SQLite3 deployment options
- Clean, modern dependency tree

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Modern Ruby & Rails** ‚ú®
- Better performance
- Improved security
- Access to modern Ruby/Rails features
- Long-term maintainability
- Security patches and support

### 2. **SQLite3 Support** üîß
- Easier development setup
- Faster local testing
- Lower barrier to entry for contributors
- Simplified CI/CD for testing
- No need for MySQL server for development

### 3. **Cleaner Dependencies** üì¶
- Removed 10+ version locks that were only needed for Ruby 2.5/2.6
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier to upgrade gems in the future

## What Changed

### Infrastructure (14 files)
- Ruby version update
- Dual Gemfile strategy (Ruby 2.5 preserved, Ruby 3.4 active)
- Gemfile dependency updates
- CI/CD configuration updates
- Spring development tool removed

### Database (10 files)
- Configuration: Database adapter now configurable via environment variable
- Migrations: Updated 7 migrations for SQLite3 compatibility
- Schema: Regenerated to reflect changes

### Application Code (1 file)
- Model: Added explicit attribute declaration for Rails 7.2 compatibility

### Tests (4 files)
- Updated for new gem behaviors
- VCR cassette matching updated
- Factory usage updated

## Migration Path

### For Existing Deployments (MySQL)
‚úÖ **No changes required** - Upgrade is transparent
- MySQL remains default
- All migrations work as before
- No data migration needed

### For New Deployments
üéØ **New option available** - Can choose SQLite3
- Set `RMT_DB_ADAPTER=sqlite3` environment variable
- Ideal for development and testing
- Skip legacy data migrations (not applicable to new databases)

## Backward Compatibility

### What's Maintained ‚úÖ
- MySQL database support (default)
- All existing functionality
- Database migration behavior for MySQL
- Ruby 2.5 dependencies preserved for reference

### What's Removed ‚ùå
- Ruby 2.5.9 support
- Rails 6.1.7 support  
- Spring development tool
- Old dependency version locks

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- SQLite3 support (additive feature, doesn't affect MySQL)
- Dependency lock removals (well-tested)
- Test updates (passing test suite)

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Rails 7.2 upgrade (major version jump, but incremental changes well-tested)
- Logger changes (affects logging behavior)

### High Risk (Mitigated) üõ°Ô∏è
- Ruby 3.4.1 upgrade (3 major versions) - **Mitigated by**: Comprehensive test suite
- Spring removal - **Mitigated by**: Not critical for production

## Testing Status

All changes have been tested through:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual testing with both MySQL and SQLite3
- CI/CD pipeline validation

## Deployment Recommendations

1. ‚úÖ **Test in staging first** with production-like data
2. ‚úÖ **Run full test suite** before deploying
3. ‚úÖ **Update Ruby version** on target systems to 3.4.1
4. ‚úÖ **Review logs** after deployment for any warnings
5. ‚úÖ **Have rollback plan** ready (standard practice)

## Timeline

- **SQLite3 Support**: Feb 20, 2025
- **Ruby/Rails Upgrade**: Feb 20, 2025
- **Both done in single day** (rapid, coordinated upgrade)
